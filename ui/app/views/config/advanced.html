            Any transaction that exceeds this amount of time will have its partial trace stored to
            disk immediately (prior to its completion).
            This is to guard against transactions which never complete (or at least run long
            enough and do enough harm to hang the jvm).
            In the case where some transactions have been configured with a very long slow threshold, the immediate
            partial trace store threshold does not take effect on those transactions until they have exceeded their slow
            threshold.
