// copied and modified from bootstrap, only the opacity values have been modified

// because IE9 (haven't tried other IE versions) has strange behavior after hovering over and out of close button
// the override in traces.less is no longer applied and the button gets very light (default bootstrap opacity .2)
// so bootstrap close.less is duplicated/modified here to handle this

  // iOS requires the button element instead of an anchor tag.
  // If you want the anchor version, it requires `href="#"`.
